# images
### A picture can say a thousand words, and great 
images help make the difference between an 
average-looking site and a really engaging one.

## Adding Images
To add an image into the page you need to use an <img>
element. This is an empty element (which means there is 
no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:
1. src :This tells the browser where it can find the image file
2. alt :This provides a text description of the image which describes the 
image if you cannot see it.

## Height & Width of Images
height :This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
width :This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

## Three Rules for Creating Images
1 . Save images in the right format
2 . Save images at the right size
3 . Use the correct resolution

### Image Formats
1 . JPEG :if you have many different colors in a picture you should use a JPEG.
2 .  GIF :Use GIF or PNG format when saving images with few colors or large 
areas of the same color.

## Figure and Figure Caption
Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new <figure> element to 
contain images and their caption so that the two are associated. 
The <figcaption> element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page 
authors to add a caption to an image

# Colors
## The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside 
an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1. rgb values ex:p {color: rgb(100,100,90);}
2. hex codes ex:h2 {color: #ee3e80;}
3. rgb values ex:h1 {color: black;}

## background-color
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the 
background-color property sets the color of the background for that box .

### Understanding Color
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, 
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

## HSL & HSLA
The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors. 
The value of the property starts with the letters hsl, followed by individual values inside 
parentheses for:hue , saturation , lightness , alpha.

# Text
we editing the text by using :
1. Weight {Light , Medium , Bold , Black}
2. Style {Normal , Italic , Oblique}
3. Stretch{Condensed , Regular , Extended}

## UpperCase & LowerCasetext-transform
The text-transform property 
is used to change the case of 
text giving it one of the following 
values:
-uppercase
This causes the text to appear 
uppercase.
-lowercase
This causes the text to appear 
lowercase.
-capitalize
This causes the first letter of 
each word to appear capitalized.

### text-decoration
The text-decoration property 
allows you to specify the 
following values:
none:This removes any decoration already applied to the text.
underline:This adds a line underneath the text.
overline:This adds a line over the top of the text.
line-through:This adds a line through words.

### text-align
The text-align property allows you to control the alignment of 
text. The property can take one of four values:
left:This indicates that the text should be left-aligned.
right:This indicates that the text should be right-aligned.
center:This allows you to center text.

## Styling Links:link, :visited
In CSS, there are two pseudoclasses that allow you to set 
different styles for links that have and have not yet been visited.
:link
This allows you to set styles 
for links that have not yet been visited. 
:visited
This allows you to set styles for 
links that have been clicked on.
