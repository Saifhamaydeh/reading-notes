# HOW HTML, CSS,& JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER 

## Web developers usually talk about three languages that
are used to create web pages:HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Where possible, aim to keep the three languages in separate files,
with the HTML page linking to CSS and JavaScript files.
Each language forms a separate layer with a different purpose.
Each layer, from left to right. builds on the previous one.

## PLACING THE SCRIPT
IN THE PAGE You may see JavaScript in the HTML between
opening <script> and closing </script> tags
(but it is better to put scripts in their own files). 

## STATEMENTS
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 

## COMMENTS
You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code. 

## WHAT IS A VARIABLE?
A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables. 

## DATA TYPES
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers,
strings, and true or false values known as
Booleans. 

## RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES
1.The name must begin with a letter
2.The name can contain letters,numbers,
3.You cannot use keywords orreserved words.
4.All variables are case sensitive, 
5.Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. 
6.If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.
