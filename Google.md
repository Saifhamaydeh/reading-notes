# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
Like most 25-year-olds, Julia Rozovsky wasn’t sure what she wanted to do
 with her life. She had worked at a consulting firm, but it wasn’t a good
 match. Then she became a researcher for two professors at Harvard, which 
was interesting but lonely. Maybe a big corporation would be a better fit.
 Or perhaps a fast-growing start-up. All she knew for certain was that 
she wanted to find a job that was more social. ‘‘I wanted to be part 
of a community, part of something people were building together,’’ she told me.
 She thought about various opportunities — Internet companies, a Ph.D. 
program — but nothing seemed exactly right. So in 2009, she chose the
 path that allowed her to put off making a decision: She
 applied to business schools and was accepted by the Yale School of Management.

Five years ago, Google — one of the most public proselytizers of how studying
workers can transform productivity — became focused on building the perfect
team. In the last decade, the tech giant has spent untold millions of dollars
measuring nearly every aspect of its employees’ lives. Google’s People 
Operations department has scrutinized everything from how frequently
particular people eat together (the most productive employees tend to 
build larger networks by rotating dining companions) to which traits the 
best managers share (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding
micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers).

After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle
 researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the 
keys to improving Google’s teams. But Rozovsky, now a lead researcher, 
needed to figure out which norms mattered most. Google’s research had identified
 dozens of behaviors that seemed important, except that sometimes the norms of
 one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful
 group.
## The key characteristics of ‘enhanced teams’
After years of analyzing data and interviews from more than 180 teams across
 the company, Google found that the kinds of people (a.k.a. the individual 
personalities) in a team are not so relevant.

“We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific 
personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’
 part of the equation didn’t seem to matter,” Dubey said in an interview
 with The New York Times.

Instead, the researchers found that there were five key characteristics of
 enhanced teams:

1. Psychological safety: Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team
 members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.
2. Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time.
3. Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are.
 These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.
4. Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial
 security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).
5. Impact: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to 
 the organization’s overall goals.
