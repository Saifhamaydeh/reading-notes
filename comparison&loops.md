# Comparison and logical operators
## you can evaluate a situation by comparing one value on the script
to what you epect it might be . 
the result will be a boolean : true or false.
== : is equal to this operator compares two values to see if they same
!= : is not equal to this operator compares two values to see if they not same
=== : strict equal to this operator compares two values to see if they same in value and data type
=== : strict not equal to this operator compares two values to see if they not same in value and data type
> : greater than this operator checks if the number on the left greater than the number on the right
< : less than this operator checks if the number on the left less than the number on the right
>= : greater than this operator checks if the number on the left greater or equl than the number on the right
<= : greater than this operator checks if the number on the left less than or equl than the number on the right

Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false 
logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comison operators
&& = logical and , || logical or , ! logical not

## loops
loops chech a condition if it returns true a code block will run
then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true
the code block will run again it repeats until the condition return false 
three typs of loops
1. for loops : its uses a counter as a condition this instucts the code to run 
a specified number of times here you can see the condition is made up of tree ststments:
- initialization
- condition
- update
2. while loop
3. do while loop
