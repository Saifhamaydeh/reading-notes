# introduction
## The Structure of This Book
### In order to teach you about creating web pages,
this book is divided into three sections:
1.HTML
2.CSS
3.Practical

## How People Access the Web
### Before we look at the code used to build
websites it is important to consider the
different ways in which people access the web
and clarify some terminology.
### Browsers
People access websites using software called a web browser.
Popular examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera .

## How Websites Are Created 
### All websites use HTML and CSS, but content
management systems, blogging software, and
e-commerce platforms often add a few more
technologies into the mix.

## How the Web Works
### When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server

# STRUCTURE
## In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping
readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey
and to navigate around the document .
### EXAMPLE ABOUT STRACTURE
in the microsoft word we using the heading 
so the heading (h1) Denote on important information or the title 
and the subheading using for information about the title
and we using the paragraph to donate about speciale topice ...
we using the same thing in web pages h1 for main heading 
below the h1 using paragraph to discripe the heading 
below that h2 subheahing ....
in the html we using tags to do the structure and we can add 
attrebute for the tags to give it meaning 

# Extra Markup
## HTML VERSIONS
IN HTML WE USING HTML5 ITS a 5th generation of html 
its more simplicity about the leatest version and html5
provide consistency in malformed documents . it has better 
error handling and it has many new tag which was present
in html4 like video , audio .....

## commints in HTML
WE USING <!--  --> TO ADD COMMINTS TO HTML CODES
AND WE USING THE COMMINTS  To clarify THE CODES

## ID Attribute 
Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.
The id attribute is known as a global attribute because it can
be used on any element.

## Class Attribute
we using the class element  identify several elements
as being different from the other elements on the page.

## Block Elements
elements will always appear to start on a new line in
the browser window.

## Inline Elements
elements will always
appear to continue on the ame line as their 
neighbouring elements.

## Grouping Text (div and span)
The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements
 together in one block-level box

## why we using iframe 
An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.
An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your
page â€” and in that window you can see another page. The term
iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.

## scrolling and frameborder
this element using in iframe to add more spicilzed

# Why we are using meta tag in HTML?
The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. ...
Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), 
search engines (keywords), and other web services.
The value of the name attribute can be anything you want it to be. 
The value maybe description , keywords , robots ....

## Escape Characters
There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code.
example about Escape Characters
1. Less-than sign : &lt; 
2. Ampersand : &amp;
3. Quotation mark : &quot;
4. Copyright symbol : &copy;

# what is the differant between traditional html layout and  new html layout 
## on the traditional layout  authors used <div> elements to group
together related elements on the page s used class or id attributes
to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.
but in the new layout make a new set of elements like  <header> , <article> 
that allow you to divide up the parts of a page.
The point of creating these new elements is so that web page authors can use 
them to help describe the structure of the page that it also makes the code
easier to follow.

# Process & Design
## How to approach building a site
the first step you must detect target audience 
It can be helpful to ask some questions about the people you
would expect to be interested inthe subject of your site like ...
What is the age range of your target audience?
What level of education do they have?
How often do they use the web? ...

## What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve
It is unlikely that you will be able to list every
reason why someone visits your site but you
are looking for key tasks and motivations. This
information can help guide your site designs.

## Site Maps
that you know what needs to appear on your site,
The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used
to structure the site

## WireFrames
A wireframe is a schematic, a blueprint, useful to help you and your programmers and designers
think and communicate about the structure of the software or website you're building.
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each
page of asite. It shows the hierarchy of the information 
and how much space it might require.
## Visual hierarchy 
refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what
they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being
displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized.

## Designing Navigation 
the nav bar must be 
1. Concise
2. Clear
3. Selective

## what is the script 
A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF INSTRUCTIONS that acomputer can follow 
to achieve a goal.You could compare scripts
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 

# OBJECTS & PROPERTIES 
OBJECTS (THINGS)
In computer programming, each physical thing in
the world can be represented as an object and give 
him PROPERTIES .
## METHODS
Methods represent things people need to do with objects. They can
retrieve or update the values of an object's properties.
