# How computer work

## What makes a computer (a computer )
the process in the computer 
1. input
2. store information 
3. process the information
4. output
these 4 things common to all computers

## how computers work : binary and data
computers works in ones and zeroez ( binary system)
binary system do play a big role how compters work inside
inside the comouters ( wires and circuts ) carry all the information in the computers
the quation now how do you srore info using electricity ?
the single wire do in on && off thats equl (yes && no ) ( 1 && 0 )
this is equl bit : the smallest piece of info a computer can store
with more bits you can represent more complex information
a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system,
 which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one). The base-2 numeral system is
 a positional notation with a radix of 2. Each digit is referred to as a bit,

## how compter work : circuits and logic
the computer contean on and off process the input process its compenation of ones and zeros
and the make the info thats the output to do this the computers contain millon of  electronec componants
work togather  on circuits .


## how compter work : cpu , memory , input , output
input in input convert the physical inputs to binary information
to do this we need to memory to store the information and cpu to process the information
after thar we can get the output (converts binary info to physical information )

 
## how compter work : hardware and software 
the hardware contain circuts , wires ,chips , speakers , plugs
the software is the programing code in the machine
