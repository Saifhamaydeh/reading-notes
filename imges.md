## Domain Names & Hosting
DOMAIN NAMES 
Your domain name is your web address (e.g. google.com or bbc.co.uk).
 There are many websites that allow you to register domain 
names. Usually you will have to pay an annual fee to keep that 
domain name.

are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet. They are specially set 
up to serve web pages when they are requested.

for the transferring of files from one system to another over the internet.
 It may be used by a business to transfer files from one computer system to another,
 or websites may use FTP to upload or download files from a website's server.

# Flash
Flash is a very popular technology used to add animations, video, and audio to 
websites. This chapter begins by looking at how to use it in your web pages.

Flash animations can incorporate text and vector graphics, they 
typically don't take up a lot of disk space. The contents of a Flash 
animation may also be compressed to further reduce the file size. 
This makes it possible for Flash content to be downloaded relatively quickly.
 Still, large Flash animations may still take a few seconds to load in your
 browser. Therefore, when you open a Web page and see a "Loading..." animation, 
it usually means Flash content is being downloaded to your computer.
