# Links 
A link (short for hyperlink) is an HTML object that allows you to jump to a new location when you click or tap it.... 
Links can be attached to text, images, or other HTML elements.Most text links are blue, 
since that is standard color web browsers use to display links.

## Writing Links
Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
ex : <a href="http://www.google.com">google</a>

## Relative Link Type
1. Same Folder
2. Child Folder
3. Grandchild Folder
4. Parent Folder
5. GrandParent Folder

Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
## Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
## Containing Elements
If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

## Positioning
1. position:relative
Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it
would have been in normal flow.
2. position:absolute
When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal
flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page
3. position:fixed
Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that
requires the position property to have a value of fixed.

### Overlapping Elements
When you use relative, fixed, or absolute positioning, boxes can
overlap. If boxes do overlap, the elements that appear later in the
HTML code sit on top of those that are earlier in the page.

Floating Elements
The float property allows you to take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing
element as possible.
Anything else that sits inside the containing element will
flow around the element that is floated .

Clearing Floats
The clear property allows you to say that no element (within the same containing element)
should touch the left or righthand sides of a box
 It can take the following values:
1. right
2. left
3. both
4. none

## Screen Sizes
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.

## Fixed Width Layouts
Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases 
the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.

*Liquid layout designs
stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the
size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)

ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS & FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS
Expressions produce a value. They can be used where values are expected.
If a function is placed where a browser expects to see an expression,
(e.g., as an argument to a function), then it gets treated as an expression. 

VARIABLE SCOPE
The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used
within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used
within that function. This is known as the variable's scope.
