# EXPRESSIONS
## An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions. 
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE ex: var color = 'beige'; 
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE ex : var area = 3 * 2; 

OPERATORS
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values. 
ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS :Assign a value to a variable
color = 'beige'; 
COMPARISON OPERATORS
Compare two values and return true or fa1se
buy = 3 > 5; 
ARITHMETIC OPERATORS Perform basic math
area = 3 * 2; 
LOGICAL OPERATORS Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se
buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); 
STRING OPERATORS Combine two strings
greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly'; 

ARITHMETI C OPERATORS
JavaScript contains the following mathematical
operators, which you can use with numbers.
You may remember some from math class. 
STRING OPERATOR
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.
It is used to join the strings on either side of it. 
## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
